# Taxonomy of Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Academic Research (with Focus on Economics and Finance)

Since the release of ChatGPT-3.5 by OpenAI in the end of 2022, Large Language Models have become nearly ubiquitous – not least, in the sphere of academic research. By providing a relatively complex and deceptive prompt (“How can we possibly address the issue of 'class imbalance' as a consequence of 'overfitting' in a network model?”), a series of Large Language Models are evaluated in accordance with a number of quantitative and qualitative parameters. We find that OpenAI ChatGPT-4 offers the best performance, followed by Meta LLaMA-2, while Microsoft Bing Chat and Google Bard do not live up to expectations. Despite their potential for several non-trivial academic tasks, Large Language Models are assessed critically. Thus, we highlight that they should first and foremost be used in the role of an assistant for the researcher rather than as a replacement. Finally, we suggest to handle Generative Artificial Intelligence with care due to potential data privacy concerns.
